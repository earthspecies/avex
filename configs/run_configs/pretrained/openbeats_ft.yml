# OpenBEATs backbone for audio classification (mean pooling + linear head)
# Fine-tuning from HuggingFace pretrained checkpoints
#
# Available pretrained checkpoints:
#   - openbeats-base-i1, openbeats-base-i2, openbeats-base-i3 (~90M parameters)
#   - openbeats-large-i1, openbeats-large-i2, openbeats-large-i3 (~317M parameters)
#
# To use a pretrained checkpoint, set:
#   - pretrained: true
#   - model_id: <checkpoint_name> (e.g., "openbeats-large-i2")
#   - model_size: base or large (auto-detected from model_id if available)
